# Solar Panel Detection Project

This project focuses on developing advanced computer vision solutions for detecting solar panels in satellite and aerial imagery using state-of-the-art deep learning models.

## Project Goals

1. Implement and compare various object detection models for solar panel detection
2. Create a robust dataset pipeline for satellite imagery processing
3. Develop tools for model evaluation and visualization
4. Optimize models for real-world deployment
